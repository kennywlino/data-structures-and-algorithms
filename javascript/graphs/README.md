# Graphs

Graphs are a non-linear data structure that have a collection of vertices connected via edges. Graphs can be either undirected, meaning that each edge points both directions-- or they can be directed where the edges are unidirectional. They have applications in representing GPS and Mapping, production recommendation and social networks.


## Challenge

In CLASS-35, we implement our own Graph class from scratch. We include a Vertex and Edge class to simulate the two pieces used within a Graph, and we use an adjacency matrix to keep track of what Edges connect What Vertex. We also include functions to traverse the Graph with both breadth and depth-first search.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API

- **Vertex** class: Stores a value.
- **Edge** class: Stores a vertex and an optional weight.

- **Graph** class:

  - addNode()
  - addEdge()
  - getNodes()
  - getNeighbors()
  - size()
