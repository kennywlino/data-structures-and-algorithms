# Stack and Queue

In this lab, we implement our own Stack, Queue and Node class from scratch.

## Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to practice implementing the Stack and Queue data structures and also to practice writing tests for our code.

## API

### Stack

The Stack class contains the following functions:

- `push()` -- adds a new Node with that value to the top of the stack
- `pop()` -- returns the value of the Node from the top of the stack and removes it
- `peek()` -- returns the value of the node located at the top of the stack *without* removing it
- `isEmpty()` -- returns a Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

### Queue

- `enqueue()` -- adds a new Node with that value to the back of the queue
- `dequeue()` -- returns the value from the Node from the front of the queue and removes it
- `peek()` -- returns the value of the Node located at the front of the queue *without* removing it
- `isEmpty()` -- returns a Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty.

## Approach & Efficiency

Here are the Big O time complexities for the above functions:

### Stack

- `push()` -- O(1)
- `pop()` -- O(1)
- `peek()` -- O(1)
- `isEmpty()` -- O(1)

### Queue

- `enqueue()` -- O(1)
- `dequeue()` -- O(1)
- `peek()` -- O(1)
- `isEmpty()` -- O(1)
