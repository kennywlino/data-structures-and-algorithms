# Singly Linked List

In this lab, we implement our own LinkedList and Node class from scratch.

## Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to practice implementing the linked list data structure and also to practice writing tests for our code.

## Approach & Efficiency

Adding in a LinkedList is an O(1) operation when adding to the front. Searching is an O(n) operation.

## API

The LinkedList class contains 3 functions:

- insert() -- to add a new item to the front of the LinkedList
- includes() -- to find whether a given value is in the LinkedList
- toString() -- a string representaiton of the LinkedList
