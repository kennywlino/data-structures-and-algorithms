# Matrix Sum

In this lab, we practiced whiteboard interviewing with a partner.

## Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is given a matrix (i.e. an array of arrays), return the sum of the inner arrays as values in an array.

## Approach & Efficiency

My approach was to use a for loop to iterate over the outer array and use an inner for loop to sum the inner arrays and put the summed values in a new array.
